- I am an enterprising young professional intending to continue my development as a web developer. In terms of results and objectives, I am enthusiastic     and work with decisiveness and conviction. My positive attitude and flexibility have seen me through projects that required teamwork. During my studies,   I discovered my passion for creating high-quality code using the best coding practices. To keep up with the rapidly changing field I started learning new   technologies and techniques.
